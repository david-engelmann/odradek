//! The CLI corpus: recorded invocations run against the real
//! binary. The oracle half was produced by the Python tool the
//! crate replaces; the clap half pins the help and usage
//! presentation the contract amendment hands to clap, together
//! with the uncaught family lines the port owns. The
//! per-source split is pinned so a case cannot silently change
//! which side of that line it sits on.
